# Browser rendering direction

## Current architecture

ManimOnline is a static editor deployed through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
`index.html` integrates ACE, DOT detection, Graphviz rendering, and a Pyodide
Manim-lite path. `src/manim-lite.py` implements a compatibility subset and generates timed frames.
`src/unified-worker.js` loads it into Pyodide; `src/manim-client.js` enforces the
90-second deadline and terminates active work on edits. The worker rebuilds the
compatibility definitions and executes source in a fresh namespace per render.
`src/manim-renderer.js` turns serialized shapes into SVG and `src/manim-player.js`
provides playback, replay, and seeking. Preview generation is limited to 900 timed
samples plus a terminal frame (60 seconds at 15 fps), with a 12 MiB serialized
result limit. These bounds do not limit arbitrary Python memory allocation.

The established direction in `todo/master_plan.md` is in-browser execution and
frame playback. Full native Manim in WebAssembly has not been demonstrated.
Manim-lite is a compatibility subset, not the Manim Community engine.

## Implemented milestone and next work

The first animation slice implements creation/fades, timed transforms, animate
method chains, waits, play/pause, replay, seeking, and current-frame SVG download.
Creation/writing use fades; transforms between different shape types crossfade.
The Scene field selects a source-defined class and defaults to the first one.
Successful renders return scene names for suggestions, and URL/shared links
preserve selection with the `scene` query parameter. Missing selections fail
explicitly; no class from previous source is used.

Uniform scale and 2D rotation are serialized as SVG transforms around geometry
centers. They support direct calls and animation chains, with explicit external
pivots. Group centers use child bounds, and text uses its anchor without full
font metrics. External-pivot animations interpolate center positions between
endpoints; rigid orbital motion is not implemented. Full Manim semantics are
not implied.

Next work can add additional verified compatibility APIs, geometry-aware path
transforms, rigid rotation animations, and an offline asset strategy. Keep DOT
rendering, sharing, and static SVG/PNG export working as these features evolve.

Use `examples/minimal_scene.py` as a baseline and `examples/multiple_scenes.py`
for scene selection with animated scale and rotation. Broader examples under `examples/`
are feature references, not an acceptance claim. Document unsupported APIs and
limits on duration/frame count. MP4 export, LaTeX, 3D, arbitrary dependencies,
updaters, and offline caching remain future work unless separately implemented.

## Verification

Check initial Pyodide loading, scene selection and URL reload, scale/rotation,
a visible animation, seeking/replay, source edits,
syntax errors, missing scenes, and a runaway loop timeout. Ensure a new source
cannot select a scene class left behind by an older render. Check DOT rendering
and export after switching away from Manim. Run tests for timing and frame state
independently of browser integration; report both categories separately.

If full Manim Community rendering becomes a requirement, revisit runtime
feasibility. A server design must isolate arbitrary submitted Python, enforce
resource limits, disable unwanted host/network access, and clean up per-job
artifacts. Do not execute user scenes in a web server process.
